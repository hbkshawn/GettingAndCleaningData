## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course project

This repo contains:
- a R script for performing the analysis required in the course project
- a code book file called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work the I performed to clean up the data
- a README.md file that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


## How the script work
After downloading the data from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Extract it into the data directory under your R working directory.
You can run R code run_analysis.R or source it. It will generate a text file named "TidyDataset.txt". This is the data set required to submit on Coursera.
